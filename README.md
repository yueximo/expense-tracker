# Expense Tracker
A simple expense tracker that allows the user to add expenses with a title, amount and date. The user can also filter their expenses by month, as well as see a visible graph that shows their expense amount by month for the year they are filtering by.

Learned the basics of React.js, styling, and hooks.

Project made during my [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

# Here is what it looks like!
